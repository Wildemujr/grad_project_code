    "# Subpace Overlap\n",

    "\n",
    "The subspace overlap is but one of the measures used to compare the subspaces determined by both the Elastic Network Model (ENM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a powerful tool to quantify the extent to which two protein simulations or fragements thereof (__A__ and __B__) explore the same conformational space. To do so, a common approach is to select a subset of eigenvectors for each ensemble, e.g., $\\pmb{v}_{1}^{A},\\dots,\\pmb{v}_{n}^{A}$ and $\\pmb{v}_{1}^{B},\\dots,\\pmb{v}_{n}^{B}$. Thus, we can use the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\Psi_{A:B} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\pmb{v}_{i}^{A} \\pmb{\\cdot} \\, \\pmb{v}_{j}^{B})^{2}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The _subspace overlap_ $\\Psi$ ranges from $0$, when the eigenvector subsets are completely dissimilar, to $1$ (or $100\\%)$ when they are identical. The number of eigenvectors used, $n$, is typically chosen so as to represent a significant proportion of the fluctuations in the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, let us calculate the subspace overlap between two trajectories.\n",
