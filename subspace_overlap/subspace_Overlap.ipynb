    "The subspace overlap is but one of the measures used to compare the subspaces determined by both the Elastic Network Model (ENM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a powerful tool to quantify the extent to which two protein simulations or fragements thereof (__A__ and __B__) explore the same conformational space. To do so, a common approach is to select a subset of eigenvectors for each ensemble, e.g., $\\pmb{v}_{1}^{A},\\dots,\\pmb{v}_{n}^{A}$ and $\\pmb{v}_{1}^{B},\\dots,\\pmb{v}_{n}^{B}$. Thus, we can use the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\Psi_{A:B} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\pmb{v}_{i}^{A} \\pmb{\\cdot} \\, \\pmb{v}_{j}^{B})^{2}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The _subspace overlap_ $\\Psi$ ranges from $0$, when the eigenvector subsets are completely dissimilar, to $1$ (or $100\\%)$ when they are identical. The number of eigenvectors used, $n$, is typically chosen so as to represent a significant proportion of the fluctuations in the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, let us calculate the subspace overlap between two trajectories.\n",
